<h1>FreeCodeCamp Work and Journey</h1>
<p>This repository is a journey of everything I have learned and record from FreeCodeCamp.</p>
<p>The code is as it was when the first challenges were solved.  Please bear in mind I did not re-write the code with advanced techniques or improved them. Instead, I have left it at the basic level. With this in mind, I will try to keep on updated the problems if necessary. </p>
